# Hey there, I'm Hetal! 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at **NYU** (GPA: 3.89) with 3 years of industry experience as a Software Engineer at SLB. I love building things at the intersection of **full-stack development**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **machine learning** — from fine-tuning LLMs to architecting distributed systems that handle millions of records.

Previously, I worked on high-availability payroll systems serving 1M+ employees across 14 countries. Now I'm deep in grad school, shipping projects across ML, cloud, and systems programming.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔍 Fine-Grained Object Detection & Classification
Compared three deep learning architectures (YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and a custom YOLO+Xception pipeline) across 120 classes and 20K+ images. The two-stage decoupled pipeline hit **98.95% mAP@50** for localization and **79.65% end-to-end classification accuracy** — outperforming both end-to-end models.

### 🏨 InnSight — Reservation Management System
Full-stack booking platform with a normalized 12-table PostgreSQL schema, PL/pgSQL triggers for conflict prevention, atomic stored procedures, and role-based access control. Built with React, Next.js 15, and Node.js — deployed on Render with SSL and Zod input validation.
`PostgreSQL` `React` `Next.js` `Node.js` `Render`

---

### 🧵 xv6 User-Level Threading Library
Built a complete N:1 threading system from scratch in C — cooperative scheduler, x86 assembly context switching, 64 concurrent threads, and synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores, condition variables, Go-style channels). Solved classic concurrency problems including producer-consumer and reader-writer with starvation prevention.

### 🤖 Fine-Tuning LLMs for Math Verification
Fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B with LoRA (rank=64) and 4-bit quantization on 50K samples, achieving **80% accuracy** on binary math solution classification. Reduced memory requirements by 75% to enable single-GPU training. Improved validation loss from 0.849 → 0.650 through custom LR scheduling and prompt engineering.
